Scripts and function that may be useful in the future

## SNP matrix codifition 
"Bob_hom" function - assumes that the SNPs come from inbred lines. 
"Bob_het" function - assumes that the SNPs come from a non-inbred population. 

## Tools
"recod" function - straigthfoward way for recoding the data set

This is a work in progress, so any comments or tips are most welcome.
